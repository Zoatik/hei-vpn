## üéØ Context

The official VPN client provided by HEI (Ivanti Secure Access) is **not compatible with Linux**.  
**HEI-VPN** was created to address this gap by providing a reliable, portable, and easy-to-use alternative that requires no manual setup. This project is heavily inspired by [**hei-vpn-for-linux**](https://git.kb28.ch/HEL/hei-vpn-for-linux.git) by [**kb28**](https://git.kb28.ch).

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Automatic connection to the HEI's Ivanti VPN
- Detects when already inside the HEI network (prevents redundant connection)
- Console interface
- Extracts `DSID` cookie from Firefox automatically
- Manages and cleans temporary Firefox profile
- Graceful shutdown with `Ctrl+C`
- Delivered as an **AppImage** for portable execution
- **No dependencies required** ‚Äì everything is bundled

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### üñ•Ô∏è 1. Use the AppImage (recommended for most users)

1. **Download the AppImage** from the [releases page](#).
2. **Make it executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x HEI-VPN.AppImage
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./HEI-VPN.AppImage
   ```
4. *(Optional)* **Add it to your app launcher**:
   - Use [Gear Lever](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) or any launcher editor (like `menulibre`, `alacarte`, `kmenuedit`) to integrate the AppImage into your system menu.

---

### üêç 2. Install via `pip` (developer/advanced usage)

If you prefer Python package management or want system-wide access:

1. **Install the package locally**:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
2. **Run from anywhere using the CLI command**:
   ```bash
   hei-vpn
   ```

---

### üë®‚Äçüíª 3. Run directly from source (dev mode)

If you‚Äôre modifying or testing the source code:

1. **Clone the repository** (or navigate to your local copy).
2. **Run the main script manually**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m hei_vpn
   ```

---

### üß† Note

- The application will automatically generate a `config.json` in `~/.config/hei-vpn/` the first time you run it.
- No manual installation of `geckodriver` or VPN software is needed ‚Äî everything is embedded or handled by the app.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Firefox must be installed with at least one default profile.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Network check**: Prevents VPN use if already inside the HEI network
- **Browser automation**: Uses Selenium and geckodriver to open Firefox and retrieve the authentication cookie
- **VPN connection**: Launches `openconnect` with the `nc` protocol using the `DSID` cookie
- **Profile management**: Temporary Firefox profile is copied, used, cleaned, and restored
- **Signal handling**: `Ctrl+C` is intercepted to gracefully shut down the VPN connection and clean up resources
